# SpecReader

Version 0.3
Simple python SpecReader, terminal/command-line based. 
Confirmed working on Linux/MacOS, should work on Windows but to be determined

Last Change:
- Added the ability to choose specifically spaced scans over an interval (ex. every 3rd scan 260-290: 260,263,266 etc...)

Use Instructions:
  Place SpecReader.py into the same folder as the Spec file you would like to process
  Open Terminal/Command line, type "Python3" and drag the SpecReader.py file into the window to automatically generate the path to it
