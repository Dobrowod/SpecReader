- BUGFIX: No longer fails to output if the first column has a negative number
- QOL CHANGE/BUGFIX: Relies on the actual spec count number instead of the number of #S's it encounters - stopping missing scans from giving incorrect outputs

June 13 2023: v0.3
- FEATURE: Added the ability to choose specifically spaced scans over an interval (ex. every 3rd scan 260-290: 260,263,266 etc...)
